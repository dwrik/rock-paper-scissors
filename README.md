#Rock, Paper, Scissors!

The classic game of rock, paper, scissors built using `html`, `css` and vanilla `javascript` as an exercise to practise DOM manipulation. This is also my first attempt at making a responsive website. This project has been built as part of [The Odin Project](https://theodinproject.com/home) full stack curriculum that am currently undertaking.

As for the project, there are buttons for each of the choices and first to 5 wins! There is also a console at the bottom which logs the results of each round.
